// Package ptr provides a collection of utility functions for pointer management in Go,
// aimed at streamlining tasks like safe dereferencing, pointer creation, value resetting, and
// pointer comparison. This package is intended to enhance code clarity and reduce repetitive
// code patterns associated with pointers.
//
// While functions like To facilitate the creation of pointers, especially for literals or
// non-addressable values, they should be used thoughtfully. It's important to evaluate the
// necessity of a pointer in each context, as unwarranted use can lead to inefficiencies,
// particularly with large structures or in performance-critical code. This function is most
// beneficial when a pointer is required, and the value being pointed to is not subject to
// further modifications that would necessitate direct use of the original variable.
//
// Other functions like ShallowCopy, Reset, and Compare provide safe and convenient ways to
// manage and compare pointer values, but their use should also be context-driven, considering
// the implications on memory usage and potential side effects, especially in concurrent
// environments.
//
// For more information you can check Example section for each function.
//
// The package, in its current development stage, is compatible with Go version go1.18 or higher,
// leveraging generics to ensure type flexibility and safety. Users should be aware of potential
// API changes in future releases as the package evolves.
